# BiasTestGPT
Repository for BiasTestGPT - Using ChatGPT for Social Bias Testing of Language Models (Link TBA)

The following repository contains the BiasTestGPT framework which uses ChatGPT controllable sentence generation for creating dynamic datasets for testing social biases in Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). It includes the 1) test ssentence generation script which can leverage any generators PLM, in particular ChatGPT as long as OpenAI key is provided. It also also contains scripts for all the processing steps from generation to bias testing. These steps, after generation, include 2) conversion of json generations into easily inspectable csv format, 3) turning generated sentences in test sentence templates with controlled social group placeholder, and 4) bias estimates per sentence, per tested attribute and per model using Stereotype Score (% of stereptyped choices in stereotype/anti-stereotype sentence pairs) metric from [Nadeem'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09456) (stereotype/anti-stereotype pairs).

## BiasTestGPT Generation Framework Steps
We describe the steps followed by the framework. One of the reasons for splitting the generaion into multile steps with separate scripts is to allow for easy inspection of generated sentences as well as for supporting modeular architecture where some steps can be improved with further techniques (e.g., a better approach of turning sentences into templates).

#### Step 1: Generating Test Sentences Using Provided Bias Specifciation
Generation of test sentences using a generator PLM. The framework accepts OpenAI models such as "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4". If OpenAI model is used <OPENAI-TOKEN> needs to be provided as input argument by the user. Th genration script also support any generative PLMs hosted on HuggingFace, such as: "gpt-j-6b" or "gpt-neo-2.7B". Generation requires a bias specification in JSON format on input, please refer to **./custom_biases/custom_biases_spec.json** for an example of such specification.

```
python3 _1_gen_test_sentences.py --bias_spec_json ./custom_biases/custom_biases_spec.json --generator_model 'gpt-3.5-turbo' --out_path './custom_biases/gen_json' --openai_token <OPENAI-TOKEN>
```

#### Step 2: Turn JSON generations into CSV for potential inspection of generated sentences
Starting from generations in JSON format (see example in **/core_biases/gen_json/**), this step generates a CSV version of the generated sentences along with additional columns for potential human annotation - *`Discarded'* and *`Reason for discard'*. The script will process all .json files in a given directory.
```
 python3 _2_gen2csv.py --source_path ./custom_biases/gen_json --out_path ./custom_biases/gen_csv 
```

#### Step 3: Turn CSV templates into stereotype/anti-stereotype pairs
This step turns the csv template sentence output from previous step into stereotype/anti-stereotype pairs. It also preserves any human annotation.
```
python3 _3_csv2pairs_rule.py --source_path ./custom_biases/gen_csv --bias_spec_json ./custom_biases/custom_biases_spec.json --out_path ./custom_biases/gen_pairs_csv
```

#### Step 4: Test Social Bias on given **Tested Model** using Stereotype Score metric from [Nadeem'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09456)(the framework currently uses this metric, but can support various metrics from [Delobelle'22](https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/8868d3/192219.pdf))
The tested model accepts paths from HuggingFace Transformer library, examples: *"bert-base-uncased", "bert-large-uncased", "gpt2", "gpt2-medium", "gpt2-large", "gpt2-xl"*. We note that the bias tests on individual generations can be misleading, therefore we suggest an additional bootstrapping step described later.
```
python3 _4_ss_test_rule.py --gen_pairs_path ./tmp/pairs --tested_model 'bert-base-uncased' --out_path ./tmp/ss_test
```

#### Step 5: Bootstrapping of Bias Test Results for Statistical Testing
We provide a Jupyter Notebook script that takes the bias test results from Step 4 and performs 30x bootstrapping of data subsets. Each subset contains exactly 4 randomly selected sentences per each attribute in bias specification. This is don to estimate the standard deviation of the bias score and perform statistical significance testing in comparison to manual templates. The script reproduces the main results from the paper.


## File Descriptions
+ **_1_gen_test_sentences.py** - generates sentences for social bias testing given bias specification and generator PLM. 
+ **_2_gen2csv.py** - converts json generation exports (*./gen_json*) into csv exports (*./gen_csv*). This is useful for for manual labeling of sentences with issues or sentence quality inspection.
+ **_3_csv2pairs.py** - converts csv sentences (*./gen_csv*) into *stereotype/anti-stereotype pairs* (*./gen_pairs_csv*) needed for applying the Stereotype Score from [Nadeem'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09456)
+ **_4_ss_test.py** - calculates the Steretype Score as a proportion of steteoryped choices based on templates with to alternatives as in *./gen_pairs_csv*. The score is exported into json format (*./ss_gen_test*). For each tested model name a new directory is created.
+ **genChatGPT.py** - manager for connection to OpenAI API for requesting generations (used internally by *_1_gen_test_sentences.py*)
+ **./core_biases/bias_specs_with_glove_and_thesaurus.json** - specification of **core biases** in JSON format containg individual biases defined by social group and attribute terms. Templates are from prior work and replaced by our generations in AutoBiasTest. Additional social grup terms ("social_groups_glove", "social_groups_thesaurus') and attribute terms ("attributes_glove", "attributes_thesaurus") are semantically similar terms generated using Glove embeddings and Merridiam-Webster Thesaurus respectively. These are used for robustness testing.
+ **./custom_biases/custom_biases_spec.json** - specification of **custom biases** in the same JSON format as for core biases. These biases, however, have not been formalized in prior work.

## Dataset Composition
Overview of the test sentence counts for different bias attributes, this includes only sentences with type column set to *'paper'*. Sentences of another type can be dynamically added to the dataset via [BiasTestGPT HuggingFace Tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/RKocielnik/bias-test-gpt) and hence their counts will change.
